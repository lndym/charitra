### Standing United
When the Pandavas were exiled, they built a small hut in the forest by a river and started living there. One day, Duryodhan decided to visit the forest to mock the Pandavas and take pleasure in their suffering. He went there with a large army. At the time, a group of Gandharvas was bathing in the river, and Duryodhan picked a quarrel with them. A fight broke out, and although Duryodhan was brave, he was no match for the Gandharvas. They captured him and took him prisoner.

When Duryodhan’s soldiers ran to the Pandavas' hut and shouted for help, Bhim and Arjun were initially delighted to hear of Duryodhan’s plight. They felt he deserved it because of his wickedness. However, Yudhishthir, the eldest brother, reminded them of their duty. He said, “Duryodhan is still our brother. Within our family, we may have disputes, but when it comes to outsiders, we are not five or one hundred—we are one hundred and five. Go quickly and rescue him from the Gandharvas.”

Following Yudhishthir’s command, Bhim and Arjun went to battle the Gandharvas. They fought bravely, defeated them, and freed Duryodhan. However, Duryodhan’s pride remained intact. He did not express gratitude to the Pandavas and returned home without even thanking them.

### Akhandanand Swami's Nishchay
Akhandanand Swami (senior) was an ardent staunch devotee with extreme patience. Once he was passing through a forest with his disciples. They saw four tigers coming towards them. The disciples hurried to climb up the trees. Akhandanand Swami said, "The death is destined according to one’s own previous actions. It is sure to come. Nobody can escape from it. You may die by falling from the tree or even by stumbling. One should not fear from death. "

The disciples climbed up the tree. The tigers came nearer. One of them ran forward and lifted his paw to kill him. Almighty Bhagwan gave them the knowledge of the greatness of Swami. The tiger was standing with his paw lifted up. Akhandanand Swami remained steadfast in remembering Shriji Maharaj. Suddenly, as if answering a call from above, the ferocious animal dropped its paw. All the tigers prostrated, circumambulated and went away.

> Bhagwan will always save you, given you never lose faith in Him
