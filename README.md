### Standing United
When the Pandavas were exiled, they built a small hut in the forest by a river and started living there. One day, Duryodhan decided to visit the forest to mock the Pandavas and take pleasure in their suffering. He went there with a large army. At the time, a group of Gandharvas was bathing in the river, and Duryodhan picked a quarrel with them. A fight broke out, and although Duryodhan was brave, he was no match for the Gandharvas. They captured him and took him prisoner.

When Duryodhan’s soldiers ran to the Pandavas' hut and shouted for help, Bhim and Arjun were initially delighted to hear of Duryodhan’s plight. They felt he deserved it because of his wickedness. However, Yudhishthir, the eldest brother, reminded them of their duty. He said, “Duryodhan is still our brother. Within our family, we may have disputes, but when it comes to outsiders, we are not five or one hundred—we are one hundred and five. Go quickly and rescue him from the Gandharvas.”

Following Yudhishthir’s command, Bhim and Arjun went to battle the Gandharvas. They fought bravely, defeated them, and freed Duryodhan. However, Duryodhan’s pride remained intact. He did not express gratitude to the Pandavas and returned home without even thanking them.

### Akhandanand Swami's Nishchay
Akhandanand Swami (senior) was an ardent staunch devotee with extreme patience. Once he was passing through a forest with his disciples. They saw four tigers coming towards them. The disciples hurried to climb up the trees. Akhandanand Swami said, "The death is destined according to one’s own previous actions. It is sure to come. Nobody can escape from it. You may die by falling from the tree or even by stumbling. One should not fear from death. "

The disciples climbed up the tree. The tigers came nearer. One of them ran forward and lifted his paw to kill him. Almighty Bhagwan gave them the knowledge of the greatness of Swami. The tiger was standing with his paw lifted up. Akhandanand Swami remained steadfast in remembering Shriji Maharaj. Suddenly, as if answering a call from above, the ferocious animal dropped its paw. All the tigers prostrated, circumambulated and went away.

> #### Moral: ###
> Bhagwan will always save you, given you never lose faith in Him

### Bhaguji - Hajuri Parshad
Once, Khabad and Mataro (two mercenaries) arrived in Gadhada with two hundred men in order to fight for disputed land. Maharaj sent Bhaguji along with a band of forty other Parshads to the site. The two parties met and fought. Khabad threw a blow of the sword on Bhaguji’s right arm, which disabled it. But Bhaguji was resilient and fought gallantly with his left hand! He threw an immense blow and cut both Khabad and his horse, defeating them. But during the fight, Bhaguji was left with the scars of 18 cuts.

Bhaguji was left in a terrible state to recuperate. Maharaj himself saw to his recovery and served him dearly. Indeed he was at his deathbed but Maharaj saw to it and fully revitalised him.

Bhaguji was felicitated by the King of Bhavnagar and offered a very lucrative post in the state’s army, but he said: “I have only one master and that too for my whole life." He was also felicitated by Maharaja Sayajirao of Baroda. When Shree Hari left this world, Bhaguji served Ayodhaprasadji Maharaj. Then, he left for Muli Mandir where he served until his last breath.
> #### Moral: ###
> Learn to serve Shreeji Maharaj selflessly and strive to become as dedicated as Bhaguji

### Shuk Muni's Faith
Shukanand Swami composed poems in Sanskrit. Once, he decided to please Maharaj by composing some poems. He wrote the poems and showed them to Maharaj. As soon as Maharaj took those poems in his hands, he threw them in water. Other poets would feel insulted by Maharaja’s act, but Shuk Muni was not offended. He then wrote other poems. Maharaj threw them into water without even reading them. This continued for some time.

Maharaj asked him, “Don’t you feel I am unappreciative?” Shuk Muni replied, “Not the least Maharaj. I was writing poems only to please you. You took pleasure in throwing all my poems into water. Your pleasure was my pleasure. My pleasure consisted of your pleasure, hence why should I feel insulted?”

Hence, Shreeji Maharaj was very pleased with Shuk Muni. Shuk Muni belonged to the village of Dabhan so Maharaj very fondly called him `Dabhanio Sadhu'. Maharaj used to say, “This Dabhanio sadhu is very useful to me.” Whoever finds pleasure in the pleasure of Shriji Maharaj is a very useful person.

> ### Moral ### 
> A poet loves his poems as parents love their children, thus if anyone
> neglects their poem, the poet feels offended. Although Shuk Muni was a
> poet, he considered Maharaj’s wishes as his own. That’s why even
> though Maharaj neglected the poems, Shuk Muni never felt insulted.
> This is called true devotion.

### Fragrance of Sandalwood
Vadtal Mandir was under construction. One day, Shreeji Maharaj visited the site. All the saints and devotees were working very hard. The work was strenuous and involved tasks like grinding lime and carrying bricks. Those engaged in this laborious work were covered in dirt and mud. Maharaj was highly pleased to see their efforts, and he said, “Come on, let us embrace.”

The saints and devotees replied, “Maharaj, our bodies are dirty and muddy.”

Maharaj responded merrily, “Who says your bodies are muddy? It is not mud; it is the fragrance of sandalwood!”

Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj embraced each of them, one by one. Such was Shreeji Maharaj—he toiled alongside others, made them work, and honored those who labored.

> ### Moral ### 
> We should strive to do seva selflessly to please Shreeji Maharaj

### Fisherman and the fish
Once, Ghanshyam Maharaj was playing with His friends Pragh, Madhav, and Veniram by the banks of a lake near Chhapaiya. They saw a fisherman in a boat, fishing. When they noticed the fish dying outside the water in baskets, Ghanshyam Maharaj became very upset. He swam up to the boat, gave life back to the fish, and returned them to the lake.

The fisherman saw this and became very angry. He started shouting at Maharaj. In response, Ghanshyam Maharaj transformed into the image of Yamraj and showed the fisherman the consequences of his actions. He revealed to the fisherman the suffering he would endure in hell for his sin.

Frightened, the fisherman pleaded with Maharaj, explaining that he was only doing this for his livelihood. Maharaj replied that there are many ways to earn a living that do not involve violence. The fisherman then promised not to kill any more fish. Ghanshyam Maharaj blessed him and redeemed him of his sins.

> ### Moral ### 
> We should always practice non-violence as it is the highest dharma

### 900,000 Blessings
The Navlakh Mountains were home to 900,000 Siddhas, all engaged in intense tapasya (penance). Each Siddha had their own designated place for penance, surrounded by lush green grass and a landscape enriched with both hot and cold springs. Giving blessings to such a vast number of Siddhas would seem impossible for most, but Nilkanth Varni manifested 900,000 images of Himself to bless them all simultaneously.

Nilkanth Varni then approached the leader of the Siddhas and inquired about the purpose of their tapascharya . The Siddha responded, “We perform tapasya to attain immortality.” Hearing this, Nilkanth Varni remarked, “I thought you were wise beings, yet you value your physical body more than your soul. The body is merely a temporary prison for the soul during its time on Earth. Instead, you should be performing tapasya to please Bhagwan and purify your soul, so it may be freed from this prison and attain eternal bliss in Akshardham.”

Realizing their mistake, the Siddhas sought guidance from Nilkanth Varni to show them the true path.

> ### Moral ### 
> We should identify ourselves as the atma (soul) whenever we do bhakti

### Initiation of Lalji Suthar
Lalji Suthar was asked by Mayaram Bhatt to go to Loj to have Maharaj’s darshan. As a devotee of Ramanand Swami, Lalji did not see a reason to go to Loj when he could simply go to Bhuj and have Ramanand Swami’s darshan. So, he decided to go to Bhuj to seek blessings from Ramanand Swami. However, when he arrived there, Ramanand Swami turned His face away.

Lalji Suthar asked Ramanand Swami what was wrong. Ramanand Swami then asked, “Did you not receive the message to go to Loj?” Lalji responded, “I did, Swami.” Ramanand Swami then asked, “Then why did you come here?” Lalji replied, “If you are here, why would I go to Loj?” Ramanand Swami explained that Lalji had made a mistake. He told Lalji that Maharaj Himself was present in Loj, so there was no point in coming to Bhuj. He added, “I am merely a follower here, following His will. He is the true Bhagwan, and He is our Ishtadev.”

Lalji Suthar responded, “I didn’t make a mistake by coming here. I have learned about His greatness, and now, when I meet Him, I will experience the excitement and reverence that I would not have felt otherwise.”

Lalji Suthar hurriedly went to Loj and asked Maharaj to stay at his place. Maharaj said, “I only stay where there is satsang, and where someone is doing satsang.” Lalji replied, “Yes, Maharaj, I will do satsang. I will sit across from You and do it.” Maharaj then set a condition: “As long as you sit across from Me and do satsang without falling asleep or yawning, I will stay. But as soon as you yawn, I will leave.” Lalji agreed.

One day passed. Then two days. Then three days. Neither Lalji Suthar nor Maharaj grew tired or hungry. Time passed, and 18 days went by. Now, Maharaj began to worry, as he needed to visit other ghams to conduct satsang and guide people towards atyantik moksha. Maharaj called Mayadevi and asked her to make Lalji Suthar yawn. At that moment, Maharaj noticed Lalji Suthar yawning and said, “Savdhan Lalji! You yawned!” Lalji Suthar responded, “Maharaj, I didn’t yawn. You made me yawn!” Maharaj smiled and said, “I need to go to Bhuj, and I need someone who knows the way so that I don’t get lost.” Lalji replied, “I know the way. I can come with you.”

They began their journey, and Maharaj started distributing the food He had brought to the hungry, the water to the thirsty, and the money to the poor. As they traveled, Maharaj and Lalji Suthar ran out of food, water, and money. That’s when they reached Padan gham.

Maharaj turned to Lalji Suthar and said, “I’m hungry.” Lalji replied, “I knew you would get hungry, but you gave everything away. Now, what should I do?” Maharaj then asked, “Why don’t you go and collect bhiksha here?” Lalji replied, “Maharaj, I can’t ask for bhiksha in this gham because it’s my in-laws’ gham, and my wife and children are here too.” Maharaj insisted, “Then I definitely want you to get bhiksha here, and from your in-laws’ house.” Lalji said, “But Maharaj, everyone in this gham knows me.” Maharaj responded, “What if we send you in disguise?” Lalji agreed.

Maharaj then shaved Lalji Suthar’s head, put a kanthi around his neck, applied tilak on his forehead, dressed him in bhagva (saffron clothes), and said, “From today, you will be known as Nishkulanand Swami.” Lalji Suthar’s dedication and service to Maharaj led him to give up his life for Maharaj and become a sadhu.

> ### Moral ### 
> Seeing the Lalji Suthar increase his Nishchay in Maharaj shows us how we should always strive to strengthen our own Nishchay

### Guru Seva of Nilkanth Varni

On the day of Ekadashi, Ramanand Swami asked Nilkanth Varni about his birthplace, caste, parents, knowledge of the Vedas, Ishtadevta, and the reason for his renunciation. Varniraj gave satisfactory replies to all the questions. Upon learning about Varniraj’s parents, Swami said, "O Brahmachari! You are one of ours. We know your parents; they met us in Prayag, and we gave them Gurudiksha. You surpass your father in many qualities and virtues."

While Swami was speaking to Varniraj in the assembly that night, a divine light emanated from Swami’s body and dispelled the darkness, filling the space with a radiant glow akin to daylight. Witnessing this miracle, all the sadhus seated there, including Varniraj, were astonished. Varniraj soon realized the divinity that resided in the body of Ramanand Swami. Similarly, Swami recognized that Nilkanth Varni was none other than Narayan himself. They accepted Varniraj into their service.

Nilkanth Varni would gather flowers, sandalwood, fragrant incense, Tulsi leaves, and other items for Swami’s seva, serving him tirelessly and with great devotion. Pleased with Nilkanth Varni’s sincerity and dedication as a disciple, Ramanand Swami decided to grant him with Maha Diksha.

> ### Moral ### 
> We should learn from the das bhav of Nilkanth Varni by doing seva of Bhagwan and our gurus. This is the key to attaining Shreeji Maharaj’s rajipo.

### Govardhanbhai's Samarpan

In the town of Mangrol near Junagadh, there lived a Baniya named Govardhanbhai. He was a devoted follower of Shreeji Maharaj and thought of Him day and night.

At his shop, whenever a customer came to buy or sell something, Govardhanbhai saw Maharaj in them. If someone delivered goods, he would record the transaction in his account book as “through Maharaj.” People often advised him, “Govardhanbhai, this is not how business works. You must write down the actual names and places.”

But Govardhanbhai would simply reply, “Swaminarayan is the only real name and place.”

Word of this unusual practice soon reached Shreeji Maharaj. Knowing Govardhanbhai’s unwavering faith, Maharaj reassured everyone, “Do not worry. Govardhanbhai has entrusted everything to Swaminarayan. And Swaminarayan is omnipresent—He will take care of everything.”

> ### Moral ### 
> Such was the faith of Govardhanbhai. And true to Maharaj’s words, Bhagwan always takes care of those who surrender everything to Him.
